##musics-(plural)-an-elaborate-list##

<p>It's a fine line between listening to music or not. It's a more than just a contemporary specific thing. It's more a primal reflection of human nature. The concept of creating art, devouring it, and then expressing satisfaction of the consuption. After this unnecessary introduction, let's browse and list a couple of playlist one could enjoy with or without alcohol on the side.</p>

** It's midnight, what should I listen to? **
I'm offering a sweet collection of new retro artists. Purpose - dive into the neon city energy and contemporary romance. The list consists of the following bands:

<li>The Midnight</li>
